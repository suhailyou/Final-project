In this project, historical stock data for Microsoft Corporation was retrieved using the Yahoo Finance Python API. The dataset spans from January 1, 2007, to April 30, 2023, and was used
for time-series forecasting of stock closing prices.
The dataset was split into 80% for training and 20% for testing. Two machine learning algorithms were implemented and compared: Moving Average and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.
The Moving Average model resulted in a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 84.59 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 30.48%. In contrast, the LSTM model significantly outperformed it, 
achieving an RMSE of 7.93 and a MAPE of 2.57%.
Based on the evaluation metrics, the LSTM model was selected due to its higher accuracy and lower error rates. The predicted closing prices generated by the LSTM closely matched both the actual 
values in the test set and the overall trends observed in the historical data.
This demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning models like LSTM in forecasting financial time series and highlights their potential for use in stock price prediction and other financial applications.
